NEURON and Mathematica files from the paper:

On the mechanisms underlying the depolarization block in the spiking
dynamics of CA1 pyramidal neurons by D.Bianchi, A. Marasco,
A.Limongiello, C.Marchetti, H.Marie,B.Tirozzi, M.Migliore (2012).
J Comput Neurosci.

The CA1 morphological neuron model has been implemented starting by
merging model files from Poirazi et al. (ModelDB accession number
20212), and from Shah et al. (ModelDB accession number 112546),
adapting a few parameters from their original values to take into
account the specific set of experimental traces used in this work, as
discussed in the Appendix of the paper.

The Simulation.hoc file in the "experiment" directory will reproduce
the results in Fig. 5 of the paper.

The Mathematica file refers to the bifurcation analysis of the
specific somatic model used in the paper.
The file will be visualized correctly with Mathematica, so save it on
your pc and then open with the software.

To run the simulation which will reproduce the results in Fig. 9, type
SHIFT + ENTER in the current Mathematica session.
