COMMENT
the preceding two numbers were switched on 8/19/92 in response to a bug
report by Bartlett Mel. In the paper the kinetic scheme is
C <-> CCa (K1)
CCa <-> OCa (beta2,alpha2)
OCa <-> OCa2 (K4)
In this model abar = beta2 and bbar = alpha2 and K4 comes from d2 and k2
I was forcing things into a nomenclature where alpha is the rate from
closed to open. Unfortunately I didn't switch the numbers.
